## Day 1
Gurudwara Sahib Visit (8:30 AM ‚Äì 9:30 AM) The day started with a peaceful visit to the College Gurudwara Sahib. The atmosphere was really calming and gave me a positive vibe. It felt like the right way to begin this new phase of life. Everyone sat quietly and listened to the prayer. It kind of set the tone for the rest of the day ‚Äî peaceful and focused.

Dr. Akshay Girdhar, Dean Academics, gave us an overview of how academics will go, how to keep a balance, and how students can get help if they‚Äôre facing any academic issues. He also mentioned the importance of consistent effort.

Dr. Parminder Singh, Dean Student Welfare, told us about the various student support systems, clubs, events, and general student life. He seemed really approachable and supportive. It made me feel more confident about adjusting to this new environment.

We also had two special guests: Ravinder Garg, Chief Engineer, shared his personal experiences and inspired us to aim high in our careers. Er. Rakesh Kumar, GNDEC alumnus from the 1991 batch, spoke about his journey after college and how GNDEC played a key role in shaping his career. Listening to an alumnus was really motivating.
