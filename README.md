## Day 6 (06/08/2025)

The day started with Sardar Gurcharan Singh Grewal, member of SGPC, who greeted everyone warmly with a ‚ÄúFateh‚Äù and told us that this wouldn‚Äôt be a lecture, but a conversation. His style was friendly and engaging right from the start.

He spoke about Guru Nanak Dev Ji and his 4 Udasian, and shared the core principles ‚Äì Kirat Karo, Naam Japo, Vand Shako. He reminded us that there are many engineering colleges in Punjab, but GNE stands out because of its focus on Vidya Veechari Tan Parupkari, its lack of corruption, and the dedication of its professors.

He encouraged us to simply follow the right path ‚Äì and told us we had already made the right choice by joining GNE. He also shared a personal note, saying that in the past, he himself had once dreamt of studying at this college. Towards the end, he invited students to share their own feelings and experiences from the induction days so far, making the session feel even more interactive.

Next, Dr. Lakhvir Singh Khana (Incharge ‚Äì CML, SWAYAM‚ÄìNPTEL Coordinator) took the stage. He gave us a brief but clear introduction to the SWAYAM and NPTEL platforms, encouraging everyone to enroll in at least one course. He explained that these are taught by IIT professors and cover a huge range of topics, allowing us to learn anything we are interested in.

He also emphasized that we should focus on NPTEL courses since they are most relevant to our academic path. We even logged in and created our accounts during the session. On my way home later, I explored the options and chose a course called Developing Soft Skills and Personality ‚Äì and I‚Äôm genuinely excited about it.

### Closing Session
The last session was by Arvind Dhingra (Director ‚Äì STEP & Incharge ‚Äì TAC). He noticed that some students were getting bored, so he cut straight to the point. He told us, ‚ÄúIf you do something with passion, then only you succeed.‚Äù

He played a quick interactive game by asking if anyone knew the last letter in the English alphabet. Someone said ‚ÄúA‚Äù, and he playfully accepted it as correct. His short 7‚Äì8 minute talk was light, engaging, and a nice way to close the day.
